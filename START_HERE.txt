   • Initial extreme type = 100% orderflow predictor
   • Enter within ±5 minutes of extreme
   • Late extremes execute 20% faster
   • 37.28 minute average window

📊 APRIL WAS AN OUTLIER
   • 1,198.50 point maximum session
   • 265.56 average (1.8x normal)

  • ROI per manipulation minute not calculated
  • And 6 more critical gaps filled

✓ COMBINES ALL DATA INTO ONE DEFINITIVE REPORT
  • Not siloed information
  • Cross-referenced and cross-validated
  • Everything connects

✓ GIVES YOU ACTIONABLE EXECUTION FRAMEWORK
